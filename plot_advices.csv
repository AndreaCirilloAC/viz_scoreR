topic_label; advicepie_chart; pie charts are rarely the better way to display data. why don’t you simply look for a well defined bar chart? further reference: http://www.businessinsider.com/pie-charts-are-the-worst-2013-6?IR=T number_of_layers;you are trying to show too many elements at once, why don’t you split your plot or introduce some facet?number_of_dimensions;you are showing three dimensions on a two dimension support. This can give a quick comparison of values of your data, but is not as well suited for accurate or precise determination it would be better to split it into two different plots, for instance employing facet_wrapnumber_of_bins;  you histogram is not the best possibile visualisation of your data. I have found that setting bins to XX produces a better visualisation of data structure.flipped_barplot; humans are better at comparing lengths when showed horizontally. Unless you are showing time-related information (i.e. time series over the x axis) try to flip your bars adding coord_flip() to your plot specification.need_for_a_smooth; it seems a strong correlation is going on between your data. Try to help the reader of your plot spotting it adding geom_smooth() to your plot.sufficient_number_of_data;your plot shows less then 20 data points. You would obtain a better result employing a table. Reference: Tufte ...overplotting;you are incurring in overplotting: there are too many points to be displayed at once in an accurate way. you should consider introducing some faceting. I have analysed your data and probably variable could be a good variable to facet on. If you want to maintain the current structure of the plot you could consider employing a different geom, like geom_bin2d, able to better avoid over plotting. use_of_heavy_background; you are employing the default ggplot theme. while it is generally fit for its purpose, you should consider removing that grey background, which lowers your data to ink ratiofilled_barplot; you are using monochromatic filled bars. that great amount of black neither  show any additional data nor convey significant message. consider change it into a geom_point or a geom_point_range presence_of_title; your plot is missing a title. this make harder for your reader to understand its content. Try to add a plot employing labs(title = “your title”)presence_of_subtitle; your plot is missing a subtitle. subtitle are effective in providing additional relevant info about metrics and data showed in your plot. Try to add a plot employing labs(subtitle = “your subtitle”)presence_of_caption; your plot is missing a caption. While not mandatory, caption are used to provide info about sources and reference period of your plot. This is crucial to increase the level of graphical integrity of your plot. Try to add a plot employing labs(caption = “your subtitle”)special_characters_in_label; your labels shows special characters. this makes them hard to read and reduce their effectiveness. try to solve this explicitly setting your labels trough labs(x = “meaningful x axis”, y = “meaningful y axis”)outliers_not_labelled; I have found some outliers in your data, and they do not seem to be explicitly labeled in your plot. To increase the level of meaningfulness you should consider labelling them.
